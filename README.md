Floating Folders for Android is insired “Assistive touch” for Iphone.
By using this shortcut floater it gives easy accessibility(shortcuts) to apps which we  can configure  in our app settings.
Currently you are using your music app , now you want to read your mail, now you need to go back home and search for mail app and then open it, instead as this floater resides on top of any app, just touch it , it displays available shortcut to other apps , now you can navigate directly.As this is kind of facebook chat floater in android , it stays upon all the apps and home screen.I want to start app as an custom service, so that user can turn on and turn off.

Features:
1)Get list of apps you can move to.
2)Start/Stop service for this floater
3)Configurable app settings.
4)Newly added features:
5)Shows the running floater as an icon, at top left, and can see it as running in notification bar.
6)Able to start or stop running floater folder from notification bar.
7)One click to start/stop service , instead of proposed buttons.
8)As i thought of view like ‘assistive touch’ of iphone, i changed the visible floater to a folder.
9)Gave an option to add or remove apps from floating folder.
